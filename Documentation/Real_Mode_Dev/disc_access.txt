files do not actually exist on disk. files are a kernel OS concept
on discks we haave filesystems which are DS that explain files. it is upto
kernel to read teh DS correctly. 

Disc just holds loads of data blocks called sectors

implementing a filesystm requires the kernel to have a filesystem driver

Data is read and written in sectors typically 512 byte blocks

reading sector of disk will return 512 bytes of data for a sector 

OLD style of reading Disc

CHS (cylinder head sector)
-- sectors are read and written y specifying a head, track , and sector 
-- isnt modern. and more complicated as we need to know how many tracks sectors etc 

MODERN style

LBA( logical block address)
-- rather than specify head track sector we just specify a numer that starts from 0
-- allows us to read from disc as if we are reading blocks from a large file 
-- LBA 0 = first sector on disc, LBA 1 = second sector

calculating LBA
ex) want to read byte at position 58376 on the disc

LBA = 58376 / 512 = 114
now if we read that LBA we can load 512 bytes into memory 
now need to know our off that our byte is in the buffer

offset = 58373 % 512 = 8

to confirm we are correct : 

114 (LBA) * 512 (#of bytes in LBA) = 58368 + 8(offset) = 58376
