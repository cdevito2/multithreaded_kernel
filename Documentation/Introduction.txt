RAM vs ROM
- ram is writeable and can be written or read from 
- ram is used only for temprary storage
- all data in RAM is lost when you power down computer 
- use RAM when you write a program that deals with variables, ex if you write a program
  in c with a int variable that stores '50', when you shut down this 50 is gone

- ROM is permament storage, retains after power loss, cant be written for normal means
- use ROM for programs that will never change, such as embedded programs. 
- BIOS is stored on a ROM. 

- memory is generally accessed in a linear fashion. example read from mem address 50, it 
  will read starting at mem address 50.
