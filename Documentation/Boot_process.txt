Steps to a booted system

1 - BIOS executed directly from ROM
2 - BIOS loads the operating system bootloader into address 0x7C00
3 - BIOS executes the bootloader which loads, kernel, which loads all other essential pieces


What is a bootloader

- small program responsible for loading kernal of an OS. 
- when a computer first boots, we are in a compatibility mode called real mode, and
  real mode only gives us access to 1 MB of memory, and only runs 16 bit code. so we have
  to load a little program called a bootloader
- so the bootloader puts us into protected mode, which gives us access to 4 GB of address
  space with 32 bit code. Then it executes kernel

Step 1 : BIOS from ROM

- CPU executes intrsuctions directly from BIOS ROM
- BIOS loads itself into RAM then continues execution so its faster
- BIOS inits essential hardware
- BIOS looks for a bootloader by searching all storage mediums for the boot signature
  0x55AA, if it finds it, it will load that sector into address 0x7C00 and will then
  exe from that address running the bootloader
- sotrage mediums can include hard disks, usb devices, floppy disks etc. 
- a sector is a block of storage. 
- if BIOS cant find the bootable medium it cant do anything else

What is the BIOS

- almost like a kernel in itself
- contains routines to assist bootloader in booting our kernel
- BIOS is 16 bit code which means only 16 bit code can execute it properly
- BIOS routines are generic and a standard
- only when processor is in real mode will it be able to execute BIOS
