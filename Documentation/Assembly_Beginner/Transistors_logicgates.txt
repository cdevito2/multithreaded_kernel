- instruction is binary , gets passed through circuit in proc which reslts in outcome

- logic gates are the way you position transistors to make certain things happen, such as
  AND XOR gates etc

- Alu is a cictuit for adding, etc

- AND gate , if both inputs are 1 it outputs 1, similar but diff logic for OR, XOR etc

- when proc reads instructions ints, data pins will be high/low with current, 
  so when a byte is laoded from memory, it will fill 8 or whatever data pins with 
  the value of that byte. then it would pass through a compilcated circuit and 
  determine wchich instruction you are trying to do. 

ex) binary 11 = decimal 3, in the example circuit one of the instructions is binary 11
    and the reslt of binary 11 could be MOV 

ex ) binary equivalent of JMP instruction would change the program counter register (holds
      value of instruction in RAM that ur currently exxecuting)

     so then in the circtuiry of proc, it would go through all the and gates and all that
     until it gets directrly to the circuitry in the proc responsible for copying the 
     value you want to jump to , to the program counter




summary:

assmebly becomes machine3 code which corresponds to the instructions from the instruction set 
processor has readable manual ( instruction set), which is built into the processor 
via transistors and logic gates that make up different connections and rules of how the
date can be transferred along the circuit.
