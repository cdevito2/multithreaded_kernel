registers

- tiny mem regions in process itself.
- mov ah, 30 = move decimal 30 into ah register
- AH and AL registers help build AX register. when you talk with AH you
  talk with the high byte of AX register. 

DS - data segments

absolute address by taking segment value , multiply it by 16 and add our offset

segmentation is needed because 16 bits cant hold the whole address

so we have a segment register which stores the offset of where data is stored

ex) if segment is 0700, and we do mov [0xff], 0x30, we are moving 0x30 into 
    0700:00FF 


IP - IP is program counter which instructions are running in mem currently

ex)

jmp _test

_test:

this just changes the IP register to point to _test
