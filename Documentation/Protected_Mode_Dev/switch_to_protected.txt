osdev going to protected mode web page 

before switching to protected you must

-disable interrupts
-enable a20 line
-load Global descriptor table 

CLI command - disable interrupts
LGDT - load descriptor table, then we set protection enable bit in CR0 register

then you jump with selector and offset being absolute address to what you want to load
then you are in protected mode 

GDT - contains entries telling CPU about mem segments. expects location of GDT desc structure 

we will use paging so we dont care about the GDT too much
