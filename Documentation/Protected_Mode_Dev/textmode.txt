allows you to write ascii to video memory, supports 16 unique colors
no need to set individual pixels for printing characters

you write ascii chars to mem starting at address 0xB8000 for colored displays
or for monochrome displays address 0xB0000

each ascii character written to this memory has its pixel equivalent outputted 
to the monitor

no need to reference any table and output character pixel by pixel. video card
does the heavy work

you take your ascii value, write it into memory, video card reference a table and sets
the pixels

each char takes up two bytes

byte 0 = ascii achar, byte 1 = colour code 

ex black 'A' at row 0 column 0

0xb8000 = 'A'
0xb0001 = '0x00' - black code

ex black 'B' at row 0 column 1
0xb0002 = 'B'
0xb0003 = 0x00
